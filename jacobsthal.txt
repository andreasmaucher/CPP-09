The Core Logic:
1. Jacobsthal Numbers as "Milestones"
Jacobsthal numbers: [0, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, ...]
These represent optimal insertion points that minimize comparisons
Each number tells us "insert up to this position"
2. The Three-Step Process:
Step 1: Collect Valid Jacobsthal Numbers
// For numPending = 9
Jacobsthal sequence: [0, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, ...]
Valid numbers (â‰¤ 9): [1, 3, 5]

Step 2: Fill Gaps Between Consecutive Pairs
// Process pairs: (1,3), (3,5)
// For pair (1,3): add 3, then fill gap [2] in descending order
// For pair (3,5): add 5, then fill gap [4] in descending order
Result: [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]

Step 3: Append Remaining Elements
// Remaining: [6, 7, 8, 9] (greater than last Jacobsthal number 5)
// Append in descending order: [9, 8, 7, 6]
Final: [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7, 6]
